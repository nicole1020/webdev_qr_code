# webdev_qr_code

this is an exercise from frontendmentor.io.
This is the image I was working from to create a webpage:

I learned about CSS:
border radius- changing the outside radius vs inside radius helps with the look. 
Also padding on the image was not good as it messed up the border, instead I used margin.
I used color picker with paint to get the RGB Value of the blue used on the background.
My mockup looks like this:
